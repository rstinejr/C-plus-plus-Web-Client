# Web client code in C++.

This code has been developed on 64-bit Linux Mint, a variant of the Ubuntu Linux distro,
with g++ (Ubuntu 4.9.2-0ubuntu1~14.04) 4.9.2

There are two m components: a library that wraps libcurl, and an app that  queries the NOAA weather site for 
Washington National Airport.  The README files in those directories provide details about their use.

The README files in *curlwrap* and *weather* describe how to build and run this program.
