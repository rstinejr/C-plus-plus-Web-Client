# Web client code in C++.

This code has been developed on 64-bit Linux Mint, a variant of the Ubuntu Linux distro,
with g++ (Ubuntu 4.9.2-0ubuntu1~14.04) 4.9.2

There are two m components: a library that wraps libcurl, and an app that  queries the NOAA weather site for 
Washington National Airport.  The README files in those directories provide details about their use.

To build this app:

1. cd to curlwrap and enter *make*
2. cd to weather and enter *make*

To execute the app, cd to weather and enter *make run*
